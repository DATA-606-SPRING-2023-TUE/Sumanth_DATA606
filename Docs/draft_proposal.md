# Introduction
There are around 18 earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or higher every year worldwide. Since 1968, actual yearly numbers have ranged from lows of 6-7 incidents each year. There are no particular symptoms/signs to know when and where the earthquakes will happen. ButÂ  earthquakes do have a distinct geographical patterns which can help to identify locations and magnitudes of certain future major earthquakes that are going to  be produced, even though we are unable to anticipate individual earthquakes.

90% of earthquakes are naturally occurring and the consequence of tectonic action. 10% of the remaining traits are connected to volcanism, human-caused effects, or other factors. Natural earthquakes are ones that happen naturally and are frequently a lot stronger than other types of earthquakes. The two theories that deal with earthquakes are the continental drift hypothesis and the plate-tectonic theory.

# Dataset

The dataset is taken from here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/database.csv. There are 23412 rows and 21 colums.


# Machine Learning Models to predict the Earth Quakes

## Random Forest

It is a classification method that also makes use of ensemble learning. The main contrast between the random forest and the decision tree is how the random forest creates a root node feature by randomly splitting. The Random forest selects a random characteristic to increase its accuracy. The random forest method moves more quickly than the bagging and boosting technique.

## Gradient Boosting Algorithm

Gradient boosting machines (GBMs), sometimes known as simply GBMs, employ a learning process that successively fits new models to provide a more accurate estimate of the response variable. The basic idea behind this technique is to construct the new base learners with as much similarity to the ensemble's overall negative gradient of the loss function as feasible. It is possible to choose the loss functions at random.

## Nueral Network

A neural network is an artificial intelligence technique that teaches computers to process data in a way  inspired by the human brain. It's a type of machine learning, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure similar to the human brain.

# Developing Model

My plan is to develop machine learning model which is faster and gives the accurate prediction of Earth Quake. I am going to use all the models which are given above and give the faster prediction of Earth Quakes.
